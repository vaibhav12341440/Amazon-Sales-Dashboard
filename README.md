## Process 


---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Data Collection**  
ðŸ“Œ Gather sales data from sources like:  
- Amazon Seller Central Reports  
- Excel/CSV files  
- Databases (SQL Server, MySQL, etc.)  
- API integration (if needed)  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Data Cleaning & Preparation**  
ðŸ“Œ Use **Power Query (ETL Process)** to:  
âœ… Remove duplicates & null values  
âœ… Convert data types (e.g., dates, numbers)  
âœ… Create calculated columns (Profit, Total Sales, etc.)  
âœ… Format date fields for time-based analysis  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Data Modeling**  
ðŸ“Œ **Create relationships** between tables (Fact & Dimension Model):  
- **Fact Table:** Sales Transactions (Order details, Revenue, Profit)  
- **Dimension Tables:** Products, Customers, Regions, Date Table  

ðŸ”¹ **Example Relationship Model:**  
- **Sales Table** (Order ID, Product ID, Customer ID, Date)  
- **Products Table** (Product ID, Name, Category, Price)  
- **Customers Table** (Customer ID, Name, Location)  
- **Date Table** (Date, Month, Year)  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Create Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**  
ðŸ“Œ Use **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)** for calculated measures:  

âœ… **Total Sales Revenue:**  
```DAX
Total Sales = SUM(Sales[Revenue])
```

âœ… **Total Profit:**  
```DAX
Total Profit = SUM(Sales[Profit])
```

âœ… **Profit Margin:**  
```DAX
Profit Margin = DIVIDE([Total Profit], [Total Sales]) * 100
```

âœ… **Average Order Value (AOV):**  
```DAX
AOV = DIVIDE([Total Sales], DISTINCTCOUNT(Sales[Order ID]))
```

âœ… **Sales Growth Rate:**  
```DAX
Sales Growth = ([Total Sales] - CALCULATE([Total Sales], PREVIOUSMONTH(Date[Date]))) / CALCULATE([Total Sales], PREVIOUSMONTH(Date[Date]))
```

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 5: Create Interactive Visualizations**  
ðŸ“Œ **Choose appropriate visuals:**  
âœ… **KPI Cards** â€“ Display **Total Sales, Total Orders, Profit Margin**  
âœ… **Bar Charts** â€“ Top-selling products & sales by category  
âœ… **Line Charts** â€“ Monthly & yearly **sales trends**  
âœ… **Map Visuals** â€“ Sales distribution across regions  
âœ… **Donut Charts** â€“ Customer segmentation & purchase behavior  
âœ… **Tables & Filters** â€“ Allow users to drill down into specific data  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 6: Dashboard Customization & Formatting**  
ðŸ“Œ **Improve user experience** by:  
âœ… Applying **themes & color schemes** for readability  
âœ… Adding **filters & slicers** (Date Range, Product Category, Region)  
âœ… Using **tooltips & drill-through options** for deeper insights  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 7: Testing & Optimization**  
ðŸ“Œ **Verify dashboard performance & accuracy:**  
âœ… Check for **calculation errors in DAX formulas**  
âœ… Optimize **large datasets** by reducing unnecessary columns  
âœ… Test **interactivity (filters, slicers, drill-throughs)**  

---

### **ðŸ”¹ Step 8: Publishing & Sharing**  
ðŸ“Œ **Deploy the dashboard** to **Power BI Service**  
âœ… Share with team members via **Power BI Workspace**  
âœ… Schedule **automated data refresh** for real-time updates  
âœ… Set up **row-level security (RLS)** for data access control
